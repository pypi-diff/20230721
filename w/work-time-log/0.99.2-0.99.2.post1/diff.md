 ## 0.99 (WIP): Getting a better view

+This is a work-in-progress release. Currently released version: `0.99.2.post1` (2022-06-28)
 
 ### New mode `view`
 
 - Until now, the only way to view entries was grouped by date (with `list`).
 - The new mode `view` allows other views on entries.
 - This version adds the `by-category` and `balance` view.

   + Main program now has a "teaser message".
   + Does not mention "protocol" any more.
 - If an invalid state is detected but fixed by the user, the originally requested command is now retried automatically.
 - Output:
   + `hours`: Both `--until` and `--target` / `-8` now print the projected balance at the assumed end time.
   + When stopping or switching, the recorded run length will be printed out, e.g.: `Stopped work at 17:30 today (30 m recorded)`
   + When an invalid state is detected, the user will no longer be offered to "abort"; instead use Ctrl-C.
+  + `config --path` now only prints the file path, enabling `subl (work config --path)`.
 - CLI:
   + `switch`: The alias `pause` will be deprecated in an upcoming version; a warning is printed if it's used.
   + `recess`: The primary name has been changed to `free-days`. The alias `recess` will remain as an option for now.
   + The short flag for `--version` is now `-V`.
 - This version removes the migration code for the info file introduced in v0.94.

This makes it easy to track the log with `git`.\n2. The tool does not run continously and instead only modifies the `work status` on disk.\n3. The `work status` is global, meaning any terminal can be used to check or update it.\n4. Checksums are used to verify that the log was not modified by another tool.\n\n## Features\n\n- Time tracking\n  + Time track while working and (optionally) add a category and message.\n  + Retroactively add and modify any entry.\n- Analyses\n  + Calculate and check the hours worked over arbitrary periods.\n  + List tracked entries by date or category with optional filters.\n- Overtime and undertime\n  + Configure "expected hours" and view the accumulated over-/undertime.\n  + (Optionally) store vacations or holidays.\n- Export entries as CSV.\n\n## Example\n\nLet\'s go over the above-described features with an example use case.\n\n### Time tracking\n\nAssume we start our workday and **enter the office at 10:00**.\nWe meet a colleague in the hall and **discuss our project until 10:30**.\nThen, we sit down at our desk and start our computer.\nWe open a shell and type:\n\n```bash\n$ work start 10\nStarted work at 10:00 today\n\n$ work switch 10:30 -c project -m "Discussion with colleague"\nSwitched work at 10:30 today (30 m recorded)\n```\n\nWhat has now happened is that we...\n\n- ...added our first entry to the log from 10:00–10:30 with category "project" and a message.\n- ...started a new work item at 10:30.\n\nAssume that we also discussed with our colleague yesterday, but we forgot to track that in our log.\nFurthermore, we worked the rest of the day on our project and developed new features.\nTo retroactively add the entries, we type:\n\n```bash\n$ work add --date yesterday 10 10:30 -c project -m "Discussion with colleague"\nAdded a record from 10:00 to 10:30 yesterday\n\n$ work add --date yesterday 10:30 16 -c project -m "Development"\nAdded a record from 10:30 to 16:00 yesterday\n```\n\nLet\'s inspect what has now been logged:\n\n```bash\n$ work ls --since yesterday\nTue, 21.06.: 2 records\n10:00 – 10:30 | 30 m      (project) "Discussion with colleague"\n10:30 – 16:00 | 5 h 30 m  (project) "Development"\n              = 6 h\n\nWed, 22.06.: 1 records\n10:00 – 10:30 | 30 m  (project) "Discussion with colleague"\n              = 30 m\n\nTotal: 3 records, 6 h 30 m worked\n```\n\nNotice:\n\n- We have added two identical entries to the log, one with `work add`, and one with `work start` and `work switch`.\n- We are currently working, but no entry has been logged yet.\n\nWe realize that we actually took a break before **starting to work at 10:45**.\nTo change the start time of the active run, we use `work start --force`.\n\n```bash\n$ work start 1045 --force\nStarted work at 10:45 today\n```\n\nNow, we want to check if this did what we expected and `work` is currently "active" and a run has been started at 10:45.\nFor that, we can do one of the following:\n\n1. `work status` checks *if a run is currently active* and additionally *informs us about our workday* (expected hours, week balance).\n\n```bash\n$ date                                            # assume it is 11:38\nWed, 22. Jun 2022, 11:38:20 CEST\n\n$ work status                                     # check work status (at 11:38)\nActive since 10:45 today (0 h 53 m)\n> 1 h 23 m worked until now – 1 entry on record   # includes log entries + active run\n> Last entry ends at 10:30                        # last entry stored in log\n\nWorkday status:\n  6 h 7 m left (until 17:45)                     # time to complete expected hours\n  Week balance: On time\n```\n\n2. `work list --include-active` (alias `ls`) lists logged entries but *includes the active run*.\n\n```bash\n$ work ls --include-active\nWed, 22.06.: 1 records (+ active run)\n10:00 – 10:30 | 30 m     (project) "Discussion with colleague"\n10:45 ~       | 0 h 53 m\n              = 1 h 23 m\n```\n\n3. Finally, we can use the special short-hand `work day`, which is equivalent to `work list --include-active --with-breaks --list-empty`.\n\n```bash\n$ work day\nWed, 22.06.: 1 records (+ active run)\n10:00 – 10:30 | 30 m     (project) "Discussion with colleague"\n              ~ 15 m break\n10:45 ~       | 0 h 53 m\n              = 1 h 23 m (+ 15 m of breaks)\n```\n\n### Analysis and modification\n\nWe want to look back at our work week and understand (1) how much we worked and (2) on which projects.\nFirst, we check *how much we worked* with `work view balance`:\n\n```bash\n$ work view balance --week\nDay      Date      Days    Expected    Worked       Balance graph\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nMon      20.06.    1       8 h         8 h          |        |        |\nTue      21.06.    1       8 h         6 h          |      ==|        |\nWed      22.06.    1       8 h         30 m         |========|        |\nThu      23.06.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nFri      24.06.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nSat      25.06.    1       -           -            |        |        |\nSun      26.06.    1       -           -            |        |        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal              7       40 h        14 h 30 m    25 h 30 m remaining\n```\n\nAs it is currently Wednesday, we have of course not logged any hours for Thursday and Friday yet.\nNote that, on Tuesday, we have accumulated 2 hours of undertime.\n\nNext, let\'s see exactly *what we worked on* this week with `work view by-category`:\n\n```bash\n$ work view by-category -w\ncategory    hours        %      records\n---------------------------------------\nproject     11 h 30 m    79%    4\nsocial      3 h          21%    1\n---------------------------------------\nTotal       14 h 30 m           5\n```\n\nThis shows us that we have spent over 20 % of our time on social events - that can\'t be right!\nWe must have a mistake in our log.\nLet\'s check by *only viewing entries with category "social"*:\n\n```bash\n$ work ls -w --Fc social\nMon, 20.06.: 1 records\n10:00 – 13:00 | 3 h  (social)\n              = 3 h\n\nTotal: 1 records, 3 h worked\n```\n\nAssume we made a mistake – we actually did not socialize from 10-13, but instead we were in a meeting from 11-13.\nLet\'s fix our mistake and *force-add an entry to override the wrong log*:\n\n```bash\n$ work ls --day mon\nMon, 20.06.: 2 records\n10:00 – 13:00 | 3 h  (social)\n13:00 – 18:00 | 5 h  (project)\n              = 8 h\n\n$ work add --force --day mon 11 13 -c project -m "Meeting"\nExisting record shortened (was 10:00 – 13:00): 10:00 – 11:00 (social) ""\nAdded a record from 11:00 to 13:00 on Monday, 20.06.2022\n\n$ work ls --day mon\nMon, 20.06.: 3 records\n10:00 – 11:00 | 1 h  (social)\n11:00 – 13:00 | 2 h  (project) "Meeting"\n13:00 – 18:00 | 5 h  (project)\n              = 8 h\n```\n\nShoot, we made a mistake. There was no meeting, instead we worked the whole day on coding in our project. Furthermore, we forgot to add a message denoting that.\n\nLet\'s reword the message of both entries with the *interactive edit mode*:\n\n```bash\n$ work edit --day mon\nEdit mode – on Monday, 20.06.2022\n\n[0] 10:00 – 11:00 (social) ""\n[1] 11:00 – 13:00 (project) "Meeting"\n[2] 13:00 – 18:00 (project) ""\n\nEnter nothing to cancel, or\nEnter one or more indices [0..2] separated by a space, or\nEnter "all" to edit all entries.\n\nWhich entries? > 1 2\n\n > Selected record: 11:00 – 13:00 (project) "Meeting"\n\n# [...]\nNew message or remove ["-"]?

The easiest way to see expected hours is to use `work view balance`:\n\n```bash\n$ work view balance --week\nDay      Date      Days    Expected    Worked       Balance graph\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nMon      20.06.    1       8 h         8 h          |        |        |\nTue      21.06.    1       -           6 h          |        |======  |\nWed      22.06.    1       8 h         30 m         |========|        |\nThu      23.06.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nFri      24.06.    1       -           -            |        |        |\nSat      25.06.    1       -           -            |        |        |\nSun      26.06.    1       -           -            |        |        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal              7       24 h        14 h 30 m    9 h 30 m remaining\n```\n\nLooks good. As Tuesday was added as a holiday, our work then counts as overtime.\nFriday is our vacation, meaning we only have 9 h 30 m remaining for this week.\n\nFinally, let\'s *predict expected work end* with the `work hours` command.\nWe only have 9 h 30 m remaining this week, meaning if we work a total of 10 hours today, we are done for the week.\nLet\'s not forget that we will take a 1 hour lunch break, though:\n\n```bash\n$ work hours --target 10 --pause 1\n30 m on record, 53 m active run | Current balance: 37 m remaining (2 h to work today)\n\nAssuming you take 1 h of breaks:\n> Work until 21:15 for a 10 hour day. | Balance then: 8 h overtime\n```\n\nSeems reasonable – let\'s go full steam and start our vacation one day early this week!\n\n\n# Release history\n\n## 0.99 (WIP): Getting a better view\n\nThis is a work-in-progress release. Currently released version: `0.99.2` (2022-06-28)\n\n### New mode `view`\n\n- Until now, the only way to view entries was grouped by date (with `list`).\n- The new mode `view` allows other views on entries.\n- This version adds the `by-category` and `balance` view.\n\n#### `view by-category`\n\n- View entries grouped by their category.\n- Use cases:\n  + Quickly view categories used in the past in a compact form.\n  + Check how much work was done for a specific project (category), e.g. in the current week.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ work view by-category --since 1.2.\ncategory            hours        %      records\n-----------------------------------------------\nproject-A/coding    16 h 30 m    40%    17\nmeetings            9 h          21%    5\n∅                   7 h          17%    19\nproject-B/coding    4 h 30 m     10%    7\nproject-B/slides    3 h 30 m     8%     4\nhelp                30 m         1%     1\n-----------------------------------------------\nTotal               41 h                76\n```\n\nAbove, `∅` is used to represent entries without a category.\n\nWe could combine this with a filter (more on the new filters below) to check how much we worked for `project-B`:\n\n```bash\n$ work view by-category --since 1.2. --Fc "project-B*"\ncategory            hours        %      records\n-----------------------------------------------\nproject-B/coding    4 h 30 m     56%    7\nproject-B/slides    3 h 30 m     44%    4\n-----------------------------------------------\nTotal               8 h                 11\n```\n\n#### `view balance`\n\n- View the balance, and how it developed, over multiple weeks or longer periods.\n- Until now, the balance was only tracked over the current week. This view allows arbitrary periods for balance calculation.\n- Use case: Check for accumulated overtime over a longer period of time, e.g. the past year or even since you started tracking your work.\n\nFor example, assuming it is Tuesday, 2022-02-22:\n\n```bash\n$ work view balance --week\nDay      Date      Days    Expected    Worked       Balance graph\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nMon      21.02.    1       8 h         8 h          |        |        |\nTue      22.02.    1       8 h         5 h 45 m     |      ==|        |\nWed      23.02.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nThu      24.02.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nFri      25.02.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nSat      26.02.    1       -           -            |        |        |\nSun      27.02.    1       -           -            |        |        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal              7       40 h        13 h 45 m    26 h 15 m remaining\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can take a look back to previous weeks, e.g.:\n\n```bash\n$ work view balance --period 3.1. 20.2.\nWeek     Date range         Days    Expected    Worked       Balance graph\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nw. 01    03.01. – 09.01.    7       32 h        32 h         |        |        |\nw. 02    10.01. – 16.01.    7       40 h        40 h         |        |        |\nw. 03    17.01. – 23.01.    7       40 h        40 h         |        |        |\nw. 04    24.01. – 30.01.    7       40 h        40 h         |        |        |\nw. 05    31.01. – 06.02.    7       40 h        37 h 30 m    |       =|        |\nw. 06    07.02. – 13.02.    7       40 h        42 h 30 m    |        |=       |\nw. 07    14.02. – 20.02.    7       40 h        45 h         |        |=       |\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal                       49      272 h       277 h        5 h overtime\n```\n\nLonger periods are grouped by month:\n\n```bash\n$ work view balance --period 1.9.21 31.12.2021\nMonth    Date range             Days    Expected    Worked       Balance graph\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSep      01.09.21 – 30.09.21    30      176 h       177 h        |        |        |\nOct      01.10.21 – 31.10.21    31      168 h       168 h        |        |        |\nNov      01.11.21 – 30.11.21    30      176 h       180 h        |        |        |\nDec      01.12.21 – 31.12.21    31      144 h       100 h        |      ==|        |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal                           122     664 h       625 h        39 h remaining\n```\n\n### Filtering for `list` (and `view`)\n\n- Beyond selecting the date (range), records can now optionally be filtered based on both category or message.\n- New flags: `--filter-category` / `--Fc` and `--filter-message` / `--Fm`\n- By default, the complete category or message must match, but glob patterns (with `*`) are supported.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ work ls\nTue, 22.02.: 3 records\n10:00 – 12:00 | 2 h   (project-B/slides)   "Slides for customer meeting on 2022-03-01"\n12:00 – 12:30 | 3 h   (project-A/coding)\n14:00 – 15:00 | 45 m                       "Cleaned office"\n              = 5 h 45 m\n\n$ work ls --Fc "project*"\nTue, 22.02.: 2 records\n10:00 – 12:00 | 2 h   (project-B/slides)   "Slides for customer meeting on 2022-03-01"\n12:00 – 12:30 | 3 h   (project-A/coding)\n              = 5 h\n\n$ work ls --Fc "project*" --Fm "*customer*"\nTue, 22.02.: 1 record\n10:00 – 12:00 | 2 h   (project-B/slides)   "Slides for customer meeting on 2022-03-01"\n              = 2 h\n```\n\n### Expanded date selection\n\n- `add`, `edit`, and `remove` now also support `--yesterday` / `-1` and `--day`\n- For `list`, `view`, and `export`:\n  + New `--since` selector equivalent to `--period X today`\n  + The `--month` selector now allows (optionally) passing a DATE, to select a month by one of its dates. E.g., `--month 1.1.` selects January of the current year.\n\n### More robust `edit`ing\n\n- The improved handling for multi-record editing introduced in v0.97 has been finalized.\n- Most noticeable will be that now multiple entries can be edited in such a way that each individual edit would be invalid, but the final state is valid again. E.g., two records (`10–12` and `12–13`) can be shifted at once (to `10–12:30` and `12:30–13`).\n- Also, if an individual edit operation encounters an error, the complete edit will be rolled back safely.\n\n### Changes\n\n- `--day` no longer accepts ambiguous prefixes such as "s".\n- `--help`:\n  + Main program now has a "teaser message".\n  + Does not mention "protocol" any more.\n- If an invalid state is detected but fixed by the user, the originally requested command is now retried automatically.\n- Output:\n  + `hours`: Both `--until` and `--target` / `-8` now print the projected balance at the assumed end time.\n  + When stopping or switching, the recorded run length will be printed out, e.g.: `Stopped work at 17:30 today (30 m recorded)`\n  + When an invalid state is detected, the user will no longer be offered to "abort"; instead use Ctrl-C.\n- CLI:\n  + `switch`: The alias `pause` will be deprecated in an upcoming version; a warning is printed if it\'s used.\n  + `recess`: The primary name has been changed to `free-days`. The alias `recess` will remain as an option for now.\n  + The short flag for `--version` is now `-V`.\n- This version removes the migration code for the info file introduced in v0.94.\n\n### Fixed bugs\n\n- `status`:\n  + Note "reduced hour day" no longer printed just because expected hours are less than 8.\n  + Note "work until" now incorporates start time of active run in calculation of end time.\n- `switch`: Now checks if the switch time equals the start time of the active run (meaning the run would simply cancelled and immediately restarted at the same time) and prints a warning instead.\n- `edit`: Invalid changes no longer lead to deletion of the last edited record.\n\n\n## 0.98: Improved selection interface and fine-grained `hours` calculation\n\nFinal release version: `0.98.1` (2021-12-18)\n\n### New `edit` and `remove` selection interface\n\n- A new selection interface to improve readability (inspired by `fish`\'s `history` tool).\n- Now allows selection of multiple indices at once.\n- By entering nothing, the selection can be immediately cancelled.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ work add 10 14 -c supre\n$ work add 15 17:5 -m "ji"\n$ work edit\nEdit mode – today\n\n[0] 10:00 – 14:00 (supre) ""\n[1] 15:00 – 17:05 () "ji"\n\nEnter nothing to cancel, or\nEnter one or more indices [0..1] separated by a space, or\nEnter "all" to edit all entries.\n\nWhich entries? > \n```\n\n### New flags for `hours` calculation\n\n- New flag `--start` to override the assumed start time.\n- New flag `--pause` to include planned breaks in the calculation.\n- Assumptions for the calculations are only printed once if multiple modes are selected.\n- Flag `--balance` removed – the balance is now always printed.\n\nFor example (assume it is 14:17):\n\n```bash\n$ work start 12\nStarted work at 12:00 today\n\n$ work hours --until 17\n0 m on record, 2 h 17 m active run | Balance: 5 h 43 m remaining (8 h to work today)\n> You will have worked 5 h at target time 17:00.\n\n$ work cancel\nRun cancelled\n\n$ work hours --until 17\n0 m on record, 0 m active run | Balance: 8 h remaining (8 h to work today)\n\nAssuming you start now (14:15):\n> You will have worked 2 h 45 m at target time 17:00.\n\n$ work add 10 12\nAdded a record from 10:00 to 12:00 today\n\n$ work hours --until 17 --target 6 --start 14 --pause 0:30\n2 h on record, 0 m active run | Balance: 6 h remaining (8 h to work today)\n\nAssuming you start at 14:00 and take 30 m of breaks:\n> You will have worked 4 h 30 m at target time 17:00.\n> Work until 18:30 for a 6:00 hour day.\n```\n\n### Changes\n\n- Corrupted files will now be detected more robustly while parsing. Specifically this covers the case that a file is formatted validly, but the contents violate assumed invariants.\n\n### Fixed bugs\n\n- `recess`: If a vacation was added over multiple years, the days were added to both years.\n- `hours`: If a day started with overtime, an exception was raised.\n\n\n## 0.97: Force actions and edit better\n\nFinal release version: `0.97.4` (released 2021-08-17)\n\n### Force `start`, `resume`, `add`\n\nA new `--force` flag allows intentionally overriding some warnings:\n\n- `start --force`: Start even if a run is already active.\n- `resume --force`: Resume even if a new run was already started (undo `switch`).\n- `add --force`: Insert entries forcefully.\n  - If an entry is *subsumed*, remove and replace it.\n  - If an entry is *overlapped*, shorten it to make space.\n  - If an entry *contains* the forced entry, split it up and shorten the splits to make space in-between.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n$ work ls\nFri, 28.05.: 1 records\n10:00 – 18:00 | 8 h  (original)\n              = 8 h\n\n$ work add 14 15 -c split --force\nExisting record split up: 10:00 – 18:00 (original) ""\n  ➜  10:00 – 14:00  &  15:00 – 18:00\nAdded a record from 14:00 to 15:00 today\n\n$ work ls\nFri, 28.05.: 3 records\n10:00 – 14:00 | 4 h  (original)\n14:00 – 15:00 | 1 h  (split)\n15:00 – 18:00 | 3 h  (original)\n              = 8 h\n```\n\n### New `edit` handling\n\n- When editing `"all"`, edits are only applied after all entries were iterated to allow cancelling any time and prevent some merge conflicts.\n- Category and message can now be removed when editing an entry by entering `"-"` as their new value.\n- Entering nothing and just pressing Enter now accepts a change, as is suggested by `[Y/n]` in the message.\n\n### `list` output improvements\n\n- `--include-active` now counts active run in total\n- `--only-time` now merges touching entries for output\n- `--with-breaks`:\n    + now shows breaks in separate lines\n    + now omits 0 minute breaks from the output.\n\n### Changes\n\n- `switch` now only allows one positional argument. To add a break before restarting, use the optional argument `--start H:M`.\n- The `--week` selector now allows an optional argument for the week number. If none is given, the current week is assumed.\n- `hours --target` now expects a string formatted as "H:M" instead of a float.\n- Entries with empty category and message are now printed as `<start> – <end> () ""`.\n- `recess`: Clearer error message when removing nonexistent day\n- completions: Global flags no longer suggested after sub-commands\n- packaging: Test modules now omitted from package\n\n### Known bugs\n\n- When editing `"all"` and changing an entry so that it would be merged with its *next* neighbor, an exception occurs.\n\n\n## 0.96: Expected hour management\n\nFinal release version: `0.96.3`\n\n### Expected hour management\n\n- New module `recess`\n  - Configure holidays, vacations, and days with reduced expected hours.\n  - The expected hours for the week and day will update accordingly.\n\nFor example:\n\n```shell\n$ work recess --add-vacation 1.2. 3.2.\n$ work recess --add-reduced-day 4.2. 2.0\n$ work recess --list\nVacation:\n  01.02.2021\n  02.02.2021\n  03.02.2021\nReduced hour days:\n  04.02.2021 (2.0 hours)\n```\n\n- Expected hours per weekday can now be configured in the RC file.\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  "expected_hours": {\n    "Monday":    8.0,\n    "Tuesday":   8.0,\n    "Wednesday": 4.0,\n    "Thursday":  8.0,\n    "Friday":    8.0,\n    "Saturday":  2.0,\n    "Sunday":    0.0\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCheck your configuration with `work config --see "expected hours"`.\n\n### Calculation of presumed work time with `hours`\n\n- `--until` now handles differently depending on if a run is active.\n- Fixes hour calculation for runs starting in the future (`--target` and `--workday`).\n- Fixes presumed start time in `--until` if no run is active.\n\n### Changes\n\n- Output messages for `switch` are now more abstract and intuitive.\n-  `work config --expected` now prints the default configuration that is used by `work config --create`.\n- **Breaking**\n    + Old configuration files are now invalid, due to added (see above) and removed (see below) keys. Create a valid configuration file with `work config --create`.\n    + Autopause functionality removed, including the configuration option\n\n\n## 0.95: export and CLI convenience\n\n- New mode `export` that enables exporting entries of any date or date range as CSV.\n- `start` now understands the keyword `again`, enabling easy back-to-back entries after a run was stopped.\n- Time parsing now understands military time, e.g. `1400` = 14:00.\n- If a corrupted record file is detected on disk, its path is now printed out.\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Handles Ctrl-C more cleanly.\n- Fixes bug where entering nothing in `rehash` lead to a rehash.\n- Fixes bug where `list --include-active` would crash if an active run starts in the future.\n\n\n## 0.94: New verification algorithm\n\n- Verification algorithm changed: Replaced MD5 hash with a much faster Adler-32 checksum.\n  - As the hash was only meant to protect against accidental edits, priorities were shifted to increase the speed.\n  - Relative speed improvement: About 20–50 % faster, more with growing size.\n  - Absolute improvement: About 1 ms for large sets of records (5 years * 200 days * 10 records).\n- Empty folders for years and months in the records directory will be removed now.\n- This version removes the migration code introduced in v0.93. Make sure to migrate your records before updating.\n\nWith this update, your info file needs to be updated once. Please run `work rehash` to do that.\n\n\n## 0.93: Performance improvements\n\n- Alias "pause" for `switch`\n- Internal structural changes that make listing a huge number of days quicker.\n- Start-up checks slimmed down to reduce start-up time.\n- Adds verification functionality for traversed record directories; if an unexpected file name or type is encountered, an error is raised.\n\nDue to a bug in previous versions, not all entries were migrated from protocol v2 to protocol v3. It is recommended to run `work ls --period 1.1.1900 31.12.2100` once (this traverses all entries in the protocol). This will fix any leftover entries automatically.\n\n\n## 0.92: switch\n\nNew `switch` function\n- The `pause` function was deprecated in favor of the new `switch` function.\n- The old functionality "stop at time A, restart at time B" has been preserved.\n- New: only one time argument can be passed.\n  - This enables a "switch in place" functionality.\n  - When a new task is started, this command suffices to save the completed work and immediately start a new task.\n\n\n## 0.9: Category and message\n\nFinal release version: `0.91`\n\n- Entries can now have an optional category and message.\n- Both can be added when stopping a run or adding an entry.\n- When listing entries, these fields can be displayed.\n',
+    'long_description': '# Work time log\n\n`work` allows manual time tracking with an interaction model inspired by `git`:\n\n1. Text files are used for storage. This makes it easy to track the log with `git`.\n2. The tool does not run continously and instead only modifies the `work status` on disk.\n3. The `work status` is global, meaning any terminal can be used to check or update it.\n4. Checksums are used to verify that the log was not modified by another tool.\n\n## Features\n\n- Time tracking\n  + Time track while working and (optionally) add a category and message.\n  + Retroactively add and modify any entry.\n- Analyses\n  + Calculate and check the hours worked over arbitrary periods.\n  + List tracked entries by date or category with optional filters.\n- Overtime and undertime\n  + Configure "expected hours" and view the accumulated over-/undertime.\n  + (Optionally) store vacations or holidays.\n- Export entries as CSV.\n\n## Example\n\nLet\'s go over the above-described features with an example use case.\n\n### Time tracking\n\nAssume we start our workday and **enter the office at 10:00**.\nWe meet a colleague in the hall and **discuss our project until 10:30**.\nThen, we sit down at our desk and start our computer.\nWe open a shell and type:\n\n```bash\n$ work start 10\nStarted work at 10:00 today\n\n$ work switch 10:30 -c project -m "Discussion with colleague"\nSwitched work at 10:30 today (30 m recorded)\n```\n\nWhat has now happened is that we...\n\n- ...added our first entry to the log from 10:00–10:30 with category "project" and a message.\n- ...started a new work item at 10:30.\n\nAssume that we also discussed with our colleague yesterday, but we forgot to track that in our log.\nFurthermore, we worked the rest of the day on our project and developed new features.\nTo retroactively add the entries, we type:\n\n```bash\n$ work add --date yesterday 10 10:30 -c project -m "Discussion with colleague"\nAdded a record from 10:00 to 10:30 yesterday\n\n$ work add --date yesterday 10:30 16 -c project -m "Development"\nAdded a record from 10:30 to 16:00 yesterday\n```\n\nLet\'s inspect what has now been logged:\n\n```bash\n$ work ls --since yesterday\nTue, 21.06.: 2 records\n10:00 – 10:30 | 30 m      (project) "Discussion with colleague"\n10:30 – 16:00 | 5 h 30 m  (project) "Development"\n              = 6 h\n\nWed, 22.06.: 1 records\n10:00 – 10:30 | 30 m  (project) "Discussion with colleague"\n              = 30 m\n\nTotal: 3 records, 6 h 30 m worked\n```\n\nNotice:\n\n- We have added two identical entries to the log, one with `work add`, and one with `work start` and `work switch`.\n- We are currently working, but no entry has been logged yet.\n\nWe realize that we actually took a break before **starting to work at 10:45**.\nTo change the start time of the active run, we use `work start --force`.\n\n```bash\n$ work start 1045 --force\nStarted work at 10:45 today\n```\n\nNow, we want to check if this did what we expected and `work` is currently "active" and a run has been started at 10:45.\nFor that, we can do one of the following:\n\n1. `work status` checks *if a run is currently active* and additionally *informs us about our workday* (expected hours, week balance).\n\n```bash\n$ date                                            # assume it is 11:38\nWed, 22. Jun 2022, 11:38:20 CEST\n\n$ work status                                     # check work status (at 11:38)\nActive since 10:45 today (0 h 53 m)\n> 1 h 23 m worked until now – 1 entry on record   # includes log entries + active run\n> Last entry ends at 10:30                        # last entry stored in log\n\nWorkday status:\n  6 h 7 m left (until 17:45)                     # time to complete expected hours\n  Week balance: On time\n```\n\n2. `work list --include-active` (alias `ls`) lists logged entries but *includes the active run*.\n\n```bash\n$ work ls --include-active\nWed, 22.06.: 1 records (+ active run)\n10:00 – 10:30 | 30 m     (project) "Discussion with colleague"\n10:45 ~       | 0 h 53 m\n              = 1 h 23 m\n```\n\n3. Finally, we can use the special short-hand `work day`, which is equivalent to `work list --include-active --with-breaks --list-empty`.\n\n```bash\n$ work day\nWed, 22.06.: 1 records (+ active run)\n10:00 – 10:30 | 30 m     (project) "Discussion with colleague"\n              ~ 15 m break\n10:45 ~       | 0 h 53 m\n              = 1 h 23 m (+ 15 m of breaks)\n```\n\n### Analysis and modification\n\nWe want to look back at our work week and understand (1) how much we worked and (2) on which projects.\nFirst, we check *how much we worked* with `work view balance`:\n\n```bash\n$ work view balance --week\nDay      Date      Days    Expected    Worked       Balance graph\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nMon      20.06.    1       8 h         8 h          |        |        |\nTue      21.06.    1       8 h         6 h          |      ==|        |\nWed      22.06.    1       8 h         30 m         |========|        |\nThu      23.06.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nFri      24.06.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nSat      25.06.    1       -           -            |        |        |\nSun      26.06.    1       -           -            |        |        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal              7       40 h        14 h 30 m    25 h 30 m remaining\n```\n\nAs it is currently Wednesday, we have of course not logged any hours for Thursday and Friday yet.\nNote that, on Tuesday, we have accumulated 2 hours of undertime.\n\nNext, let\'s see exactly *what we worked on* this week with `work view by-category`:\n\n```bash\n$ work view by-category -w\ncategory    hours        %      records\n---------------------------------------\nproject     11 h 30 m    79%    4\nsocial      3 h          21%    1\n---------------------------------------\nTotal       14 h 30 m           5\n```\n\nThis shows us that we have spent over 20 % of our time on social events - that can\'t be right!\nWe must have a mistake in our log.\nLet\'s check by *only viewing entries with category "social"*:\n\n```bash\n$ work ls -w --Fc social\nMon, 20.06.: 1 records\n10:00 – 13:00 | 3 h  (social)\n              = 3 h\n\nTotal: 1 records, 3 h worked\n```\n\nAssume we made a mistake – we actually did not socialize from 10-13, but instead we were in a meeting from 11-13.\nLet\'s fix our mistake and *force-add an entry to override the wrong log*:\n\n```bash\n$ work ls --day mon\nMon, 20.06.: 2 records\n10:00 – 13:00 | 3 h  (social)\n13:00 – 18:00 | 5 h  (project)\n              = 8 h\n\n$ work add --force --day mon 11 13 -c project -m "Meeting"\nExisting record shortened (was 10:00 – 13:00): 10:00 – 11:00 (social) ""\nAdded a record from 11:00 to 13:00 on Monday, 20.06.2022\n\n$ work ls --day mon\nMon, 20.06.: 3 records\n10:00 – 11:00 | 1 h  (social)\n11:00 – 13:00 | 2 h  (project) "Meeting"\n13:00 – 18:00 | 5 h  (project)\n              = 8 h\n```\n\nShoot, we made a mistake. There was no meeting, instead we worked the whole day on coding in our project. Furthermore, we forgot to add a message denoting that.\n\nLet\'s reword the message of both entries with the *interactive edit mode*:\n\n```bash\n$ work edit --day mon\nEdit mode – on Monday, 20.06.2022\n\n[0] 10:00 – 11:00 (social) ""\n[1] 11:00 – 13:00 (project) "Meeting"\n[2] 13:00 – 18:00 (project) ""\n\nEnter nothing to cancel, or\nEnter one or more indices [0..2] separated by a space, or\nEnter "all" to edit all entries.\n\nWhich entries? > 1 2\n\n > Selected record: 11:00 – 13:00 (project) "Meeting"\n\n# [...]\nNew message or remove ["-"]?

Merging...\n    11:00 – 13:00 (project) "Development"\n  + 13:00 – 18:00 (project) "Development"\n  = 11:00 – 18:00 (project) "Development"\nEdited 2 records\n\n$ work -d ls --day mon                                         19:59:04\nMon, 20.06.: 2 records\n10:00 – 11:00 | 1 h  (social)\n11:00 – 18:00 | 7 h  (project) "Development"\n              = 8 h\n```\n\nThereby, we could also see a second hidden feature: entries with the *same category and message* that are adjacent in the protocola are *automatically merged*.\n\n### Overtime and undertime\n\nIn the previous examples, we can already see the *overtime calculation* at work.\nBased on the configured *expected hours* to work, it calculates over- and undertime.\nTo configure the expected hours, simply edit the configuration file:\n\n```bash\n$ vim (work config --path)\n```\n\nOne other case may arise – atypical free days such as holidays or vacations.\nOn such days, we do not expect to work, even if it is a regular day of the week.\nTo make sure that overtime and undertime are correctly calculated, we can add these as follows:\n\n```bash\n$ work -d free-days --add-holiday 21.\nAdded holiday on 21.06.2022\n\n$ work -d free-days --add-vacation 24.\nAdded vacation on 24.06.2022\n```\n\nThis also shows us that date parsing is *relative to the current day*, allowing us to just state "24." for "24.06.2022".\n\nNow, let\'s verify this did what we expect it to. The easiest way to see expected hours is to use `work view balance`:\n\n```bash\n$ work view balance --week\nDay      Date      Days    Expected    Worked       Balance graph\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nMon      20.06.    1       8 h         8 h          |        |        |\nTue      21.06.    1       -           6 h          |        |======  |\nWed      22.06.    1       8 h         30 m         |========|        |\nThu      23.06.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nFri      24.06.    1       -           -            |        |        |\nSat      25.06.    1       -           -            |        |        |\nSun      26.06.    1       -           -            |        |        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal              7       24 h        14 h 30 m    9 h 30 m remaining\n```\n\nLooks good. As Tuesday was added as a holiday, our work then counts as overtime.\nFriday is our vacation, meaning we only have 9 h 30 m remaining for this week.\n\nFinally, let\'s *predict expected work end* with the `work hours` command.\nWe only have 9 h 30 m remaining this week, meaning if we work a total of 10 hours today, we are done for the week.\nLet\'s not forget that we will take a 1 hour lunch break, though:\n\n```bash\n$ work hours --target 10 --pause 1\n30 m on record, 53 m active run | Current balance: 37 m remaining (2 h to work today)\n\nAssuming you take 1 h of breaks:\n> Work until 21:15 for a 10 hour day. | Balance then: 8 h overtime\n```\n\nSeems reasonable – let\'s go full steam and start our vacation one day early this week!\n\n\n# Release history\n\n## 0.99 (WIP): Getting a better view\n\nThis is a work-in-progress release. Currently released version: `0.99.2.post1` (2022-06-28)\n\n### New mode `view`\n\n- Until now, the only way to view entries was grouped by date (with `list`).\n- The new mode `view` allows other views on entries.\n- This version adds the `by-category` and `balance` view.\n\n#### `view by-category`\n\n- View entries grouped by their category.\n- Use cases:\n  + Quickly view categories used in the past in a compact form.\n  + Check how much work was done for a specific project (category), e.g. in the current week.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ work view by-category --since 1.2.\ncategory            hours        %      records\n-----------------------------------------------\nproject-A/coding    16 h 30 m    40%    17\nmeetings            9 h          21%    5\n∅                   7 h          17%    19\nproject-B/coding    4 h 30 m     10%    7\nproject-B/slides    3 h 30 m     8%     4\nhelp                30 m         1%     1\n-----------------------------------------------\nTotal               41 h                76\n```\n\nAbove, `∅` is used to represent entries without a category.\n\nWe could combine this with a filter (more on the new filters below) to check how much we worked for `project-B`:\n\n```bash\n$ work view by-category --since 1.2. --Fc "project-B*"\ncategory            hours        %      records\n-----------------------------------------------\nproject-B/coding    4 h 30 m     56%    7\nproject-B/slides    3 h 30 m     44%    4\n-----------------------------------------------\nTotal               8 h                 11\n```\n\n#### `view balance`\n\n- View the balance, and how it developed, over multiple weeks or longer periods.\n- Until now, the balance was only tracked over the current week. This view allows arbitrary periods for balance calculation.\n- Use case: Check for accumulated overtime over a longer period of time, e.g. the past year or even since you started tracking your work.\n\nFor example, assuming it is Tuesday, 2022-02-22:\n\n```bash\n$ work view balance --week\nDay      Date      Days    Expected    Worked       Balance graph\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nMon      21.02.    1       8 h         8 h          |        |        |\nTue      22.02.    1       8 h         5 h 45 m     |      ==|        |\nWed      23.02.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nThu      24.02.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nFri      25.02.    1       8 h         -            |========|        |\nSat      26.02.    1       -           -            |        |        |\nSun      27.02.    1       -           -            |        |        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal              7       40 h        13 h 45 m    26 h 15 m remaining\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can take a look back to previous weeks, e.g.:\n\n```bash\n$ work view balance --period 3.1. 20.2.\nWeek     Date range         Days    Expected    Worked       Balance graph\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nw. 01    03.01. – 09.01.    7       32 h        32 h         |        |        |\nw. 02    10.01. – 16.01.    7       40 h        40 h         |        |        |\nw. 03    17.01. – 23.01.    7       40 h        40 h         |        |        |\nw. 04    24.01. – 30.01.    7       40 h        40 h         |        |        |\nw. 05    31.01. – 06.02.    7       40 h        37 h 30 m    |       =|        |\nw. 06    07.02. – 13.02.    7       40 h        42 h 30 m    |        |=       |\nw. 07    14.02. – 20.02.    7       40 h        45 h         |        |=       |\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal                       49      272 h       277 h        5 h overtime\n```\n\nLonger periods are grouped by month:\n\n```bash\n$ work view balance --period 1.9.21 31.12.2021\nMonth    Date range             Days    Expected    Worked       Balance graph\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSep      01.09.21 – 30.09.21    30      176 h       177 h        |        |        |\nOct      01.10.21 – 31.10.21    31      168 h       168 h        |        |        |\nNov      01.11.21 – 30.11.21    30      176 h       180 h        |        |        |\nDec      01.12.21 – 31.12.21    31      144 h       100 h        |      ==|        |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal                           122     664 h       625 h        39 h remaining\n```\n\n### Filtering for `list` (and `view`)\n\n- Beyond selecting the date (range), records can now optionally be filtered based on both category or message.\n- New flags: `--filter-category` / `--Fc` and `--filter-message` / `--Fm`\n- By default, the complete category or message must match, but glob patterns (with `*`) are supported.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ work ls\nTue, 22.02.: 3 records\n10:00 – 12:00 | 2 h   (project-B/slides)   "Slides for customer meeting on 2022-03-01"\n12:00 – 12:30 | 3 h   (project-A/coding)\n14:00 – 15:00 | 45 m                       "Cleaned office"\n              = 5 h 45 m\n\n$ work ls --Fc "project*"\nTue, 22.02.: 2 records\n10:00 – 12:00 | 2 h   (project-B/slides)   "Slides for customer meeting on 2022-03-01"\n12:00 – 12:30 | 3 h   (project-A/coding)\n              = 5 h\n\n$ work ls --Fc "project*" --Fm "*customer*"\nTue, 22.02.: 1 record\n10:00 – 12:00 | 2 h   (project-B/slides)   "Slides for customer meeting on 2022-03-01"\n              = 2 h\n```\n\n### Expanded date selection\n\n- `add`, `edit`, and `remove` now also support `--yesterday` / `-1` and `--day`\n- For `list`, `view`, and `export`:\n  + New `--since` selector equivalent to `--period X today`\n  + The `--month` selector now allows (optionally) passing a DATE, to select a month by one of its dates. E.g., `--month 1.1.` selects January of the current year.\n\n### More robust `edit`ing\n\n- The improved handling for multi-record editing introduced in v0.97 has been finalized.\n- Most noticeable will be that now multiple entries can be edited in such a way that each individual edit would be invalid, but the final state is valid again. E.g., two records (`10–12` and `12–13`) can be shifted at once (to `10–12:30` and `12:30–13`).\n- Also, if an individual edit operation encounters an error, the complete edit will be rolled back safely.\n\n### Changes\n\n- `--day` no longer accepts ambiguous prefixes such as "s".\n- `--help`:\n  + Main program now has a "teaser message".\n  + Does not mention "protocol" any more.\n- If an invalid state is detected but fixed by the user, the originally requested command is now retried automatically.\n- Output:\n  + `hours`: Both `--until` and `--target` / `-8` now print the projected balance at the assumed end time.\n  + When stopping or switching, the recorded run length will be printed out, e.g.: `Stopped work at 17:30 today (30 m recorded)`\n  + When an invalid state is detected, the user will no longer be offered to "abort"; instead use Ctrl-C.\n  + `config --path` now only prints the file path, enabling `subl (work config --path)`.\n- CLI:\n  + `switch`: The alias `pause` will be deprecated in an upcoming version; a warning is printed if it\'s used.\n  + `recess`: The primary name has been changed to `free-days`. The alias `recess` will remain as an option for now.\n  + The short flag for `--version` is now `-V`.\n- This version removes the migration code for the info file introduced in v0.94.\n\n### Fixed bugs\n\n- `status`:\n  + Note "reduced hour day" no longer printed just because expected hours are less than 8.\n  + Note "work until" now incorporates start time of active run in calculation of end time.\n- `switch`: Now checks if the switch time equals the start time of the active run (meaning the run would simply cancelled and immediately restarted at the same time) and prints a warning instead.\n- `edit`: Invalid changes no longer lead to deletion of the last edited record.\n\n\n## 0.98: Improved selection interface and fine-grained `hours` calculation\n\nFinal release version: `0.98.1` (2021-12-18)\n\n### New `edit` and `remove` selection interface\n\n- A new selection interface to improve readability (inspired by `fish`\'s `history` tool).\n- Now allows selection of multiple indices at once.\n- By entering nothing, the selection can be immediately cancelled.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ work add 10 14 -c supre\n$ work add 15 17:5 -m "ji"\n$ work edit\nEdit mode – today\n\n[0] 10:00 – 14:00 (supre) ""\n[1] 15:00 – 17:05 () "ji"\n\nEnter nothing to cancel, or\nEnter one or more indices [0..1] separated by a space, or\nEnter "all" to edit all entries.\n\nWhich entries? > \n```\n\n### New flags for `hours` calculation\n\n- New flag `--start` to override the assumed start time.\n- New flag `--pause` to include planned breaks in the calculation.\n- Assumptions for the calculations are only printed once if multiple modes are selected.\n- Flag `--balance` removed – the balance is now always printed.\n\nFor example (assume it is 14:17):\n\n```bash\n$ work start 12\nStarted work at 12:00 today\n\n$ work hours --until 17\n0 m on record, 2 h 17 m active run | Balance: 5 h 43 m remaining (8 h to work today)\n> You will have worked 5 h at target time 17:00.\n\n$ work cancel\nRun cancelled\n\n$ work hours --until 17\n0 m on record, 0 m active run | Balance: 8 h remaining (8 h to work today)\n\nAssuming you start now (14:15):\n> You will have worked 2 h 45 m at target time 17:00.\n\n$ work add 10 12\nAdded a record from 10:00 to 12:00 today\n\n$ work hours --until 17 --target 6 --start 14 --pause 0:30\n2 h on record, 0 m active run | Balance: 6 h remaining (8 h to work today)\n\nAssuming you start at 14:00 and take 30 m of breaks:\n> You will have worked 4 h 30 m at target time 17:00.\n> Work until 18:30 for a 6:00 hour day.\n```\n\n### Changes\n\n- Corrupted files will now be detected more robustly while parsing. Specifically this covers the case that a file is formatted validly, but the contents violate assumed invariants.\n\n### Fixed bugs\n\n- `recess`: If a vacation was added over multiple years, the days were added to both years.\n- `hours`: If a day started with overtime, an exception was raised.\n\n\n## 0.97: Force actions and edit better\n\nFinal release version: `0.97.4` (released 2021-08-17)\n\n### Force `start`, `resume`, `add`\n\nA new `--force` flag allows intentionally overriding some warnings:\n\n- `start --force`: Start even if a run is already active.\n- `resume --force`: Resume even if a new run was already started (undo `switch`).\n- `add --force`: Insert entries forcefully.\n  - If an entry is *subsumed*, remove and replace it.\n  - If an entry is *overlapped*, shorten it to make space.\n  - If an entry *contains* the forced entry, split it up and shorten the splits to make space in-between.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n$ work ls\nFri, 28.05.: 1 records\n10:00 – 18:00 | 8 h  (original)\n              = 8 h\n\n$ work add 14 15 -c split --force\nExisting record split up: 10:00 – 18:00 (original) ""\n  ➜  10:00 – 14:00  &  15:00 – 18:00\nAdded a record from 14:00 to 15:00 today\n\n$ work ls\nFri, 28.05.: 3 records\n10:00 – 14:00 | 4 h  (original)\n14:00 – 15:00 | 1 h  (split)\n15:00 – 18:00 | 3 h  (original)\n              = 8 h\n```\n\n### New `edit` handling\n\n- When editing `"all"`, edits are only applied after all entries were iterated to allow cancelling any time and prevent some merge conflicts.\n- Category and message can now be removed when editing an entry by entering `"-"` as their new value.\n- Entering nothing and just pressing Enter now accepts a change, as is suggested by `[Y/n]` in the message.\n\n### `list` output improvements\n\n- `--include-active` now counts active run in total\n- `--only-time` now merges touching entries for output\n- `--with-breaks`:\n    + now shows breaks in separate lines\n    + now omits 0 minute breaks from the output.\n\n### Changes\n\n- `switch` now only allows one positional argument. To add a break before restarting, use the optional argument `--start H:M`.\n- The `--week` selector now allows an optional argument for the week number. If none is given, the current week is assumed.\n- `hours --target` now expects a string formatted as "H:M" instead of a float.\n- Entries with empty category and message are now printed as `<start> – <end> () ""`.\n- `recess`: Clearer error message when removing nonexistent day\n- completions: Global flags no longer suggested after sub-commands\n- packaging: Test modules now omitted from package\n\n### Known bugs\n\n- When editing `"all"` and changing an entry so that it would be merged with its *next* neighbor, an exception occurs.\n\n\n## 0.96: Expected hour management\n\nFinal release version: `0.96.3`\n\n### Expected hour management\n\n- New module `recess`\n  - Configure holidays, vacations, and days with reduced expected hours.\n  - The expected hours for the week and day will update accordingly.\n\nFor example:\n\n```shell\n$ work recess --add-vacation 1.2. 3.2.\n$ work recess --add-reduced-day 4.2. 2.0\n$ work recess --list\nVacation:\n  01.02.2021\n  02.02.2021\n  03.02.2021\nReduced hour days:\n  04.02.2021 (2.0 hours)\n```\n\n- Expected hours per weekday can now be configured in the RC file.\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  "expected_hours": {\n    "Monday":    8.0,\n    "Tuesday":   8.0,\n    "Wednesday": 4.0,\n    "Thursday":  8.0,\n    "Friday":    8.0,\n    "Saturday":  2.0,\n    "Sunday":    0.0\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCheck your configuration with `work config --see "expected hours"`.\n\n### Calculation of presumed work time with `hours`\n\n- `--until` now handles differently depending on if a run is active.\n- Fixes hour calculation for runs starting in the future (`--target` and `--workday`).\n- Fixes presumed start time in `--until` if no run is active.\n\n### Changes\n\n- Output messages for `switch` are now more abstract and intuitive.\n-  `work config --expected` now prints the default configuration that is used by `work config --create`.\n- **Breaking**\n    + Old configuration files are now invalid, due to added (see above) and removed (see below) keys. Create a valid configuration file with `work config --create`.\n    + Autopause functionality removed, including the configuration option\n\n\n## 0.95: export and CLI convenience\n\n- New mode `export` that enables exporting entries of any date or date range as CSV.\n- `start` now understands the keyword `again`, enabling easy back-to-back entries after a run was stopped.\n- Time parsing now understands military time, e.g. `1400` = 14:00.\n- If a corrupted record file is detected on disk, its path is now printed out.\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Handles Ctrl-C more cleanly.\n- Fixes bug where entering nothing in `rehash` lead to a rehash.\n- Fixes bug where `list --include-active` would crash if an active run starts in the future.\n\n\n## 0.94: New verification algorithm\n\n- Verification algorithm changed: Replaced MD5 hash with a much faster Adler-32 checksum.\n  - As the hash was only meant to protect against accidental edits, priorities were shifted to increase the speed.\n  - Relative speed improvement: About 20–50 % faster, more with growing size.\n  - Absolute improvement: About 1 ms for large sets of records (5 years * 200 days * 10 records).\n- Empty folders for years and months in the records directory will be removed now.\n- This version removes the migration code introduced in v0.93. Make sure to migrate your records before updating.\n\nWith this update, your info file needs to be updated once. Please run `work rehash` to do that.\n\n\n## 0.93: Performance improvements\n\n- Alias "pause" for `switch`\n- Internal structural changes that make listing a huge number of days quicker.\n- Start-up checks slimmed down to reduce start-up time.\n- Adds verification functionality for traversed record directories; if an unexpected file name or type is encountered, an error is raised.\n\nDue to a bug in previous versions, not all entries were migrated from protocol v2 to protocol v3. It is recommended to run `work ls --period 1.1.1900 31.12.2100` once (this traverses all entries in the protocol). This will fix any leftover entries automatically.\n\n\n## 0.92: switch\n\nNew `switch` function\n- The `pause` function was deprecated in favor of the new `switch` function.\n- The old functionality "stop at time A, restart at time B" has been preserved.\n- New: only one time argument can be passed.\n  - This enables a "switch in place" functionality.\n  - When a new task is started, this command suffices to save the completed work and immediately start a new task.\n\n\n## 0.9: Category and message\n\nFinal release version: `0.91`\n\n- Entries can now have an optional category and message.\n- Both can be added when stopping a run or adding an entry.\n- When listing entries, these fields can be displayed.\n',
